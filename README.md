# Ship_position
Use data in JSON form (from www.marinetraffic.com), aggregate data and sort them by boat and finally create a text file and KLM file.

*The inputs are in two forms : 
    *extended input ( ship id, latitude, longitude, time and extended ship imput like the name, the country,etc.)
    *abbreviated input (with just the ship id, latitude, longitude and time).


It's a practical work using python 2.7
